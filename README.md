Euphoria
========

A .NET application for finding uniquely-leveled/numbered Team Fortress 2 items on TF2WH.com.

<br><br><b>Getting started</b><br><br>
To start Euphoria, download and compile all the source code files. Make sure that the file called "TF2 HATS.txt" is in the same directory as the compiled .EXE. Then, run the .EXE.
<br><br>
Once Euphoria is running, go to the Active Search List and click on the top row to make a new search.
Each search consists of 7 parameters. If a particular parameter is not specified (i.e. its box is blank), then it will not affect the search
<pre>
Keyword - only item names that contain this value will be searched. (e.x. A keyword of "huntsman" would exclude any item without "huntsman" in their name).
Levels - a comma-separated list of levels to search for. Only items that have matching levels will be searched.
Craft #s - identical to levels, except this uses craft numbers.
Buyer ID64 - the Steam ID64 of the person buying/collecting the items.
Outpost ID - the numerical ID of a TF2 Outpost trade relevant to the search.
Notes - a place for additional information about the search.
Search mode - specifies when the search will be performed.
  Automatic - search will always be carried out
  Manual - search will only be carried out when the user clicks the "Search" button (i.e. it won't be carried out during automatic searching)
  Disabled - search will never be carried out
</pre>
